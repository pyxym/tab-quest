# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**TabAI** is an AI-powered browser tab management extension that uses artificial intelligence to automatically organize, analyze, and optimize users' browsing experience. The extension learns from user patterns and provides intelligent suggestions for tab management.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Plasmo Framework (Browser Extension)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom AI-themed design system
- **Build System**: Plasmo CLI
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js (planned), Natural.js (planned)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Package extension for distribution
npm run package
```

## Architecture Overview

### State Management
- **tabStore**: Manages tab data, groups, and active tab state
- **aiStore**: Handles AI insights, patterns, and productivity metrics

### Component Architecture
- All UI components are AI-branded with gradient themes
- Components use Tailwind CSS with custom AI color palette
- Dark mode support built-in

### AI Features (MVP Phase)
1. **Auto Grouping**: Domain-based and content-based tab categorization
2. **AI Insights**: Tab usage patterns and optimization suggestions
3. **Productivity Score**: AI-calculated browsing efficiency metrics
4. **Smart Sessions**: Context-aware tab session management

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Component Composition**: Small, reusable components (AILogo, AIInsightCard)
2. **Store Pattern**: Centralized state with Zustand for predictable updates
3. **AI-First UI**: Every feature emphasizes AI capabilities
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work offline, advanced features require API

## Chrome Extension Permissions

Current permissions in manifest:
- `tabs`: Access to tab information
- `storage`: Store user preferences and AI data
- `activeTab`: Interact with current tab

## Development Tips

1. Use `chrome.tabs` API for tab management operations
2. All AI calculations currently run client-side
3. Tailwind classes are purged in production build
4. Hot reload works for popup and content scripts
5. Extension ID changes between builds in dev mode

## Testing Approach

Currently no tests configured. Recommended approach:
- Unit tests for AI logic and utilities
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright for extension flows
